    <h2 class="heading">Akesh in One <span> Page</span></h2>

    <p>Hello again! &#x1F600;  I'm Akesh Kumar from Himachal Pradesh, a 20-year-old üòé Data Science enthusiast, and there's an interesting  story behind how I entered the world of data science.</p>

    <p>Since childhood I have been interested in robotics and technology, I actively participate in school quizzes and science fairs and successfully top 	&#x1F3C5; most of the competitions. But in my high school, due to lack of connectivity &#x1F611; in my area (no option to choose science stream), I opted for Arts &#x1F62A; , but I did not leave Mathematics and Computer &#x26C5;. At that time I was unaware of this world of programming and Data science.</p>
    
    <p>Then I joined BCA in my neighboring district. That was the first time I wrote a program; Yes, of course üòè, it was the "Hello World" program. In college life, I learned many new things, learned about web development and software development, learned HTML, CSS and everything. I also got a job offer after the first year of graduation. So I planned to join after completing my graduation and I accepted that offer. Gradually I started learning	&#x1F55D; new things. Then like every college student, I also had to make a project in the final semester along with studies, so I started making it from the beginning of the semester.</p>
    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Mission Earth</span>-<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QwGbEwTsoOJqW1EqNpsRlvY9khoMF6BH?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration:underline;">Animal Cruelty Awareness Project</a> - I created this project with all my efforts, formulated the problem, prepared the system requirements, and applied all the knowledge of SDLC. To turn my thinking into a software system, I took the first step: collecting data. I conducted surveys and collected information from studies already done. Then, based on the data findings, I made decisions and designed solutions. I documented everything and presented it to my college. The final project surprised both me and my teacher. But what is worth noting is that everything I did in this process is part of the data science project life cycle, and I was not aware of it at all at the time.</p>
    
    <p>So, when I was researching about areas after completing my BCA, I saw a blog post with thumbnails of graphs, pie charts and all. I clicked on it because I used these graphs and visualizations in my project. I read this and then I realized that all these things mentioned here I have already done in my life during the time of the project which I enjoyed a lot at that time. Hence, I decided to dive in this artistic world of science of data.</p>
    
    <p> Now, I am on a learning path and continuously giving my best &#x1F600; every day in the process. That‚Äôs itüòÅ.</p>
    <p>Thank you! üòá for spending your precious time reading about me.</p>
