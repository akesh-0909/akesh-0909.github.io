   <p> I am 20 years old, and there is an interesting story behind how I entered the data science world. Since childhood, I have been interested in robotics and technology, actively participating in school quizzes and science fairs, and successfully holding top positions in most of the competitions. But in my high school, due to a lack of connectivity in my area (no option to choose the science stream), I opted for Arts, but I didn't leave maths and computers. At that time, I was unaware of this programming and science world.</p>

   <p> Then I joined BCA in my neighboring district. That time was the first when I wrote a program; yes, of course, it was the Hello World program. In college life, I learned many new things, got to know about web development, software development, learned HTML, CSS, and all. I even got a job offer after my first year of Graduation. So the plan is to join after completing my bachelor's, and I held that offer. In upcoming years, my plan is to study new things, get to know about many things. Then, in the final semester, alongside studies, we had to do a project, so I started making it right from the beginning of the semester. </p>
    
    <p>The Mission Earth project - I made this project with my full efforts, formulated the problem, formulated system requirements, and applied all the knowledge of SDLC. To convert my thinking into a software system, I took the first step: data gathering. I conducted surveys, collected information from already done studies. Then, based on findings from the data, I made decisions, formulated solutions. The final project amazed both myself and my teacher. I documented everything and presented it in front of my college. But the point to note is that the steps I implemented in this process are all part of the data science project life cycle, and I didn't know that these things I was doing are really done in data science. </p>
    
   <p> So, when I was researching after completing my BCA about fields, I saw a blog post with thumbnails of graphs, pie charts, and all. I clicked on that because I had used these graphs and visualizations in my project. I read it and realized that data science is related to my interest, and then I dived into Data Science. </p>
   <h3>Thats it!</h3>
